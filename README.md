# Squash and Publish (for Mercurial)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mapio/hg-sap.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mapio/hg-sap)

A tool to publish a [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) repositoty
squasing intermedaite (working) commits.

This tool can be used to build a workflow where a *working* repository
(subject to frequent commits) is periodically released to a *public*
repository *collapsing in a single changeset* all the changes happened between
two releases.

It works using the
[collapse](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension#Collapsing)
capability of the
[rebase](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension)
extension, and
keeping track of the last squashed revision using a
[bookmark](http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Bookmarks)
(in the working repository).

At every every invocation, the tool pulls the working repository to a squasing
one, where it collapses all the revisions between the last squashed commit and
the tip; finally the tool pushes the branch with collapsed revisions to the
public repository.


## Example

As an example, consider the following execution:

	$ hg init work

	$ cd work
	... do some work ...
	$ hg commit
	... do some work ...
	$ hg commit
	... do some work ...
	$ hg commit
	... do some work ...
	$ hg commit

	$ cd ..
	$ hg-sap work public
	*** Squasing 'work' revs 4417615f6ecb:6b4fa3685130 in 'public'...   done!
	*** Revs in 'work':
	f258fed5de13 Version 0
	4417615f6ecb Version 1
	29ccfc46fbfa Version 2
	6b4fa3685130 Version 3
	*** Revs in 'public':
	f258fed5de13 Version 0
	a83aa5aaacab Squashed from 4417615f6ecb to 6b4fa3685130

	$ cd work
	... do some work ...
	$ hg commit

	$ cd ..
	$ hg-sap work public
	*** Squasing 'work' revs 8d89cd5a6f4b:8d89cd5a6f4b in 'public'...   done!
	*** Revs in 'work':
	f258fed5de13 Version 0
	4417615f6ecb Version 1
	29ccfc46fbfa Version 2
	6b4fa3685130 Version 3
	8d89cd5a6f4b Version 4
	*** Revs in 'public':
	f258fed5de13 Version 0
	a83aa5aaacab Squashed from 4417615f6ecb to 6b4fa3685130
	b967a0910e60 Squashed from 8d89cd5a6f4b to 8d89cd5a6f4b

## Exercising Mercurial

As a side tool, developed in order to test `hg-sap`, in the
[test/functions](test/functions) file you can find a set of shell functions to
exercise Mercurial in a randomized way.

That is to say, in such file you can find a function to:

- `add` a file (with random name, and contaning random text),
- `remove` a file (at random),
- `edit` a file (adding, or deleting lines at random, containing random text),
- `rename` a file (choosen at random, in another with a random name),
- `work` that performs the previous actions (choosen at random).

All functions operate on a repository named after the `$REPOSITORY`
environment variable. For example, you can run it as:

	$ export REPOSITORY=a_test_repo
	$ . ./test/functions
	$ add
	add file 'file-L9B.txt'
	$ add
	add file 'file-JUI.txt'
	$ edit
	edit file 'file-JUI.txt'
	$ edit
	edit file 'file-JUI.txt'
	$ edit
	edit file 'file-L9B.txt'
	$ delete
	delete file 'file-L9B.txt'
	$ rename
	rename file 'file-JUI.txt' to 'file-YGC.txt'
	$ hg -R $REPOSITORY log -r 0:tip --template '{rev} {desc}\n'
	0 add file 'file-L9B.txt'
	1 add file 'file-JUI.txt'
	2 edit file 'file-JUI.txt'
	3 edit file 'file-JUI.txt'
	4 edit file 'file-L9B.txt'
	5 delete file 'file-L9B.txt'
	6 rename file 'file-JUI.txt' to 'file-YGC.txt'

Such file is used in the [test/randomized](test/randomized) test.

## Warning

The tool is at a very **alpha stage** and will not check that all the
performed passes complete succesfully; on the other hand, it will never modify
the working repository (except for updating the bookmark), so it should be
"reasonably safe" to be used.
